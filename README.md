About the project:
- The program is a fully functional full stack web app that allows users to log in or create a profile, and find other students for roommates
- The app includes a chat functionality which creates a chat room between two people who have matched each other that allows users to communicate in realtime
- Users are automatically recommended by an AI model based on users' preferences (ex. program of study, sleep schedule, etc.)

The process:
- Created the application frontend with `React.js`
- Set up up a database using `MonogoDB` to act as our backend to the project and to store our users profiles, data, and messages
- Implemented the AI model to curate roomate recommendations via a `Python` backend using the `pandas` library (reading through the database and computing a compatibility score between 2 people)
- Integrated the database, backend, and frontend together using the `Flask` and `PyMongo` libraries
