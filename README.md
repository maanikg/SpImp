About the project:
- The app allows users to record their speech and will compute a score for the speech and provide feedback based on various metrics such as volume, speed, tone, and clarity
- By using machine learning models of different speech categories, the app is able to classify the quality of speech in real-time

The process:
- Developed the app frontend with `SwiftUI`
- Created machine learning models via `CreateML` (`CoreML`) with over 90% validation accuracy for various speech metrics
- Set up the backend to manage authentication and save user info with `Firebase`
